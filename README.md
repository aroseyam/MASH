# MASH

# Introduction
The Game M.A.S.H. is a childhood game that would be able to tell your future
by answering questions in multiple categories. This particular game that I've designed
contains 7 categories. Which are Colleges, People you might marry, Cities, Number of
kids, College Majors, and Occupations. In each category the user will be giving 3
answers of their choice. After answering all categories the output will tell a little
fortune.

# Design and Implementation
The design of my project is a user input into a list for each category. After the user
input selections are added a random generated number between 0-2 is picked to
decide which index is then selected into the fortune story.

#Conclusions
During this project I've learned that coding is a process. You can write a game or
code in multiple different ways. During this process I tried numerous ways to rewrite
the same process.
The best feature I added was the random selection of the index. In the real
world game the number is usually selected by the user who draws swills to determine
the number. Processing differently would be to store the user data and enabling the
user to change some of the inputs to something else.
